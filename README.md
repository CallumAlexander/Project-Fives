# Project Fives
#### by Cal Alexander
An digital client to play Fives

**_WARNING : NEVER EDIT THIS README IN GITHUB!!!_**

## Things I want to implement
In no particular order
- [ ] AI difficulties - i.e likelihood to mess up and call a non multiple of 5
- [ ] Start the player at a random game position rather than position 0
- [ ] Allow the bots to shotgun if the player is too slow
- [ ] Have the player manually shotgun
- [ ] Have the option to go left or right
- [ ] Implement 1v1 game stage with two hands per player
- [ ] Allow for the addition of multiple hands to a player during main game, i.e. for messing up
- [ ] Implement a nicer display, maybe using pygame at a later stage
- [ ] Have lower difficulty bots accidentally call a number during shotgun
- [ ] Have some sort of big celebration if a player wins on spuds
- [ ] Allow for multiple IRL players???
